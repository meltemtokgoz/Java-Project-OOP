Object-oriented programming (OOP) is more than just adding a few new features to programming languages.
It is rather a new way of thinking about decomposing and modeling problems with less complexity and 
more code reuse when developing programming solutions. In OOP, a program is viewed as a collection of loosely connected objects, 
each of which is responsible for specific tasks. It is through the interaction of these objects that computation proceeds
and the model works as a whole.

In this assignment, you will work with the concepts of OOP in order to practice them and observe their advantages. 
By the end of this assignment, you will learn the concepts of relationships among classes, encapsulation, abstraction,
inheritance and polymorphism, as well as how to and why use Javadoc in your Java projects.
